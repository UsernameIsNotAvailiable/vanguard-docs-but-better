## Documentation Conventions

- `Vanguard.Method(...)` and `Vanguard:Method(...)` are both supported by public methods on the main module.
- Utility objects use normal Lua method conventions. Call instance methods with `:` unless a guide explicitly says otherwise.
- Server examples belong in `ServerScriptService`; client examples belong in `StarterPlayerScripts` or another client container.
- A callback shown as returning `boolean, string?` should return `true` on success or `false, reason` on rejection.
- Ordering described as alphabetical uses the registered object's `Name`.

## Version

These docs describe Vanguard `0.1.13` and network protocol `1`.
