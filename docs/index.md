# Vanguard Documentation

This directory is the complete guide and reference for Vanguard. The root project README is a quick introduction; these documents cover behavior, guarantees, edge cases, and the full public API.

!!! warning "Developer Notice"
    Vanguard is currently available through [Wally](https://wally.run/package/twrblxdevs/vanguard). The source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/TwrblxDevs/vanguard).
!!! warning "Developer Notice"
    Vanguard is in early development and receives frequent updates. Check [Wally](https://wally.run/package/twrblxdevs/vanguard) for the newest published version and the [changelog](changelog/index.md) for work in progress.
!!! tip "Developer Workflow"
    Use Rojo and Wally together with Vanguard for the smoothest development experience.

## Utilities

The [utility index](utilities/index.md) explains when to use each utility.

| Utility | Guide |
| --- | --- |
| Cache | [Cache](utilities/cache/index.md) |
| Class | [Class](classes/index.md) |
| Cleaner | [Cleaner](utilities/cleaner/index.md) |
| Component | [Components](components/index.md) |

## Operations

| Guide | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting/index.md) | Startup errors, Wally paths, remote failures, and debugging checklists |
| [Migrating from Knit](migration-from-knit/index.md) | Hook aliases, API mapping, and migration differences |
| [Roadmap](roadmap/index.md) | Plugin Developer API, Toolbox distribution, utilities, tooling, docs, and contributions |

## What's Next

Vanguard `0.1.15` is planned around a stable **Plugin Developer API** with
versioned manifests, lifecycle hooks, dependency ordering, cleanup ownership,
and linked diagnostics. Later roadmap work includes a Roblox Toolbox release,
additional utilities, expanded documentation, Studio tooling, and a clearer
community contribution process.

Roadmap features are not available until they appear in the
[Changelog](changelog/index.md) as released behavior.

## Documentation Conventions

- `Vanguard.Method(...)` and `Vanguard:Method(...)` are both supported by public methods on the main module.
- Utility objects use normal Lua method conventions. Call instance methods with `:` unless a guide explicitly says otherwise.
- Server examples belong in `ServerScriptService`; client examples belong in `StarterPlayerScripts` or another client container.
- A callback shown as returning `boolean, string?` should return `true` on success or `false, reason` on rejection.
- Ordering described as alphabetical uses the registered object's `Name`.

## Version

These docs describe Vanguard `0.1.14` and network protocol `1`. Vanguard `0.1.15` is the next planned release; see the [Roadmap](roadmap/index.md).
